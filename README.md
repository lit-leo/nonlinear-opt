# Solving non-linear equations as convex minimization problem
Final project for Large-Scale Optimization course at Skoltech.

# Experiments:
1) Implement and test Newton’s algorithm. 
2) Implement and test the Modified Gauss-Newton Method.
3) Implement and test the conjugate gradients: the Fletcher-Reeves or the Polyak-Ribiere version.
4) Implement and test the accelerated residuals method
5) Implement and test the convex restrictions algorithm

# Data
1) Power flow equations - pypower cases
2) Custom generated data
